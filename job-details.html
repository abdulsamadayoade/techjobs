                    <p>About Us</p>

                    <p>Paystack is YC-backed (including by Reid Hoffman), rapidly growing and a great place for those
                        looking for both impact and a fast-paced tech startup environment. Read more about the journey
                        in
                        Reid Hoffman’s words.</p>

                    <p>Our product is an app-based solution that lets immigrants send money back home to emerging
                        markets
                        instantly and at very low prices. Since launching in summer 2018, we’ve already moved tens of
                        millions of dollars and reached tens of thousands of customers. We’re live in seven European
                        countries, and we support payments into Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Cameroon and
                        Bangladesh; with lots more countries launching soon.</p>

                    <p>Global remittances account for over $500 billion annually, most of which moves back into
                        developing
                        countries. But the market is dominated by traditional services that are expensive, can take days
                        to
                        arrive, and have limited reach in rural areas. We're helping people to send that money instantly
                        and
                        securely at a fraction of the cost.</p>

                    <p>In addition to Reid Hoffman, we are backed by Canaan, Flourish Ventures, Helios and others. Our
                        team
                        is based across London, New York, Paris and Brussels and we pride ourselves on hiring
                        exceptional
                        talent -- our team members come from a wide variety of top-tier tech companies, professional
                        services firms, and industry leaders, including Twitter, Yahoo, Amazon, Google, McKinsey, Bain &
                        Co,
                        KPMG, Cravath, and Vodafone.</p>

                    <p>To continue our rapid growth, we're looking to bring on people who are passionate about our
                        mission
                        and excited to work in a small start-up environment. We have competitive salary and stock
                        options
                        and great benefits, and we were recently rated one of the best companies to escape to by Escape
                        the
                        City's "Escape 100".</p>

                    <p>The Role</p>

                    <p>We are looking for a Software Engineer to join our small but growing engineering team to define,
                        build and iterate on features for our consumer-facing product! You will work closely with
                        Product,
                        Operations, Customer Support and other functions to build a reliable, intuitive, and simple
                        experience for our users. As an early member of the team, we hope you will also have a lot of
                        impact
                        on our team culture, processes and norms.</p>

                    <p>Taptap Send is a cross-platform mobile app developed with React Native and Flow, which talks to a
                        backend service written in Kotlin and backed by a PostgreSQL database, all of which runs on AWS
                        and
                        is managed via Terraform and Ansible. This is a frontend-focused role, but you will have plenty
                        of
                        opportunities to work on all parts of our tech stack.</p>

                    <p>We’re excited to grow the team in order to tackle our upcoming challenges, which include scaling
                        up
                        to handle increased volume, improving UI and UX to drive growth and retention, handling
                        increasingly
                        sophisticated fraud attacks, building internal tools for our customer support and acquisition
                        efforts, and much more.</p>
